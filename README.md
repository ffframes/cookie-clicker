cookie-clicker
-forgot to make the repo, so this is what we have so far
-started with making the basic html structure
-in javascript started by making the basic querySelector list and their functions
-give the cookies their value and cps
-change click value to 10,000 for ease of testing
-create async function upgrades with cookie API
-need to figure out how to add second interval for cookiespersecond
-can't figure out why cookies number isnt' going up every second
-sorted
-i think the game is finished, this was hard



Action //	Where is it saved?
Clicking Cookie	cookies + 10000	// Local Storage & Screen
Buying Upgrade	cookies ↓ / CPS ↑	// Local Storage & Screen
Every Second	cookies increases	// Local Storage & Screen
Reset	Everything → 0	// Local Storage deleted

///

DONE 🎯 Fetch upgrade data from the provided API and at least one upgrade from the API update the cookie count.
DONE I THINK?🎯 Ensure that functions are used effectively to keep code organised and reusable.
DON 🎯 Implement event listeners to handle user interactions.
DONE 🎯 Use local storage to save and restore the cookie count and relevant game information.
NOT DONE, FIGURING IT OUT🎯 Use setInterval to increment the cookie count and manage the game state each second.

DONE 🐿️ As a developer, I want to use a single function to handle all upgrades, so that the code is more organized and easier to maintain.
